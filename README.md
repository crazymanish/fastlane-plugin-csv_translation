## About csv_translation

A fastlane plugin to manage translation using a CSV file under git repository. ðŸš€

This plugin is inspired by and based on [Keep a CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) under git repository. This CSV file can contains translated details for different locales, which can be defined as CSV headers.
This plugin opens up an opportunity to automate reading from/writing of any `CSV` file with [`fastlane`](https://fastlane.tools). 

## CSV file (Example)
`CSV` file must have locale headers, and can have one identifier header. i.e Below CSV supports `"en-US","nl-NL","de-DE","fr-FR","it","es-ES","pt-PT","da","sv","no","zh-Hans","zh-Hant"` and `Ticket` column is the unique identifier column which later will be useful to a delete CSV row

## Example

You have to **remember to keep your release notes CSV file up-to-date** with translation and let [`fastlane`](https://fastlane.tools) do the rest. 

``` ruby
desc "Release a iOS appstore build to AppStore iTunesConnect with translated release notes."
lane :release do
  gym # Build the app and create .ipa file
  
  version_number = get_version_number # Get project version
  
  # Get translated release notes
  release_notes = get_csv_translation_requests(
                    repository_name: "repo_owner/repo",
                    file_path: "release_notes/#{version_number}.csv"
                  )

  # TODO: Inject release notes into fastlane meta-data

  deliver # Upload ipa file to iTunesConnect with localized release notes `meta-data`
  
  slack(message: "Hi team, New version #{version_number} is avaliable!) # share on Slack
end
```
